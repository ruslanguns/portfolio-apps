# Portfolio Apps

This is a collection of apps I've built for fun and for learning and practice, the inspiration is to create this portfolio that allow me to stay active and learn new things.

I found a really interesting article about [15 amazing apps ideas to build](https://blog.bitsrc.io/15-app-ideas-to-build-and-level-up-your-coding-skills-28612c72a3b1). I guess they are really well structured and they contain a lot of useful information as well user-stories to help you to understand the idea better, like in a real project. So I find it really interesting to build a portfolio of apps from these ideas.

Each project will be in a folder, and each folder. I will create a project for each of them using Github Canvan and will add a link to the project in the README.md file in each project.

I will try to use different technologies and frameworks to build the apps, but I will try to use the most common ones so that I can have a better understanding of the modern web development tools.
